Hello my name is Donna. I became interested in coding about two years ago. I would attempt to try a few coding lessons but it appeared so foreign and confusing. As a result, I continued to place the coding lessons on the back burner.  This past month I decided to give it a try. It is very time consuming, frustrating and requires a lot of patience. I found myself going back and forth rereading the material. On several occasions I questioned myself about the difficulty I encountered understanding the material. However, I continued to persist.  Finally I saw some light at the end of the tunnel. This light gave me the motivation that I needed to continue. In addition the various messages received via email from Flatiron School was also a motivating factor.
